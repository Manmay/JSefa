Feature Highlights

* General

  * Stream-based serialization of Java objects and back again with support for XML, CSV, and FLR
  
    It is possible to serialize java objects of different classes into the same stream (even for CSV and FLR) as well as to deserialize them.
    
  * Selective deserialization
  
    Say that you have a large XML document with a lot of different elements and you are interested in <<< <product> >>> elements only.
    Furthermore these elements may contain a lot of different sub elements, but you are interested only in a subset of these.
    You can state this with JSefa and you get only what you want. And if the underlying xml schema evolves (new child elements),
    your deserialization code still works. Something similar to this is possible also with CSV and FLR.      
  
  * Usage is independent of the exchange format
  
    Only the code to construct an <<<IOFactory>>> depends on the exchange format (XML, CSV, FLR) - its usage to create a new <<<Serializer>>> or <<<Deserializer>>> as well as their usage
    does not depend on it.
  
  * Extensible to support other formats as well

  * Optimized for high throughput (it's fast)
  
    For example, XML serialization of 100.000 java objects consisting of 10 <<<String>>> fields each takes 2 seconds only (on my non-pimped Thinkpad Z61m).
    
  * Low memory footprint
  
  * Usage of annotations - no binding file nor design-time code generation needed
  
    The mappings between java types and the types of the exchange format (XML, CSV, FLR) can be defined via annotating the java class and its fields.
    JSefa also provides an API for constructing mappings, so it is amenable to alternative ways of mapping declarations (e. g. mapping creation based on an xml schema)
    
  * Easy declaration of simple types with specific format and converter
  
    For example you can specify the format of a field of type <<<Date>>> to be <<<dd.MM.yyyy>>> just by adding <<<format = "dd.MM.yyyy">>> to the annotation.
    You can also write your own converter and state that this converter should be used for this specific field. By providing a converter you can define additional simple types.
    
  * Different configuration levels
  
    You can set configuration parameters at three different levels. For example you can state that for each <<<Date>>> the <<<XmlDateTimeConverter>>> should be responsible (in contrast to the default <<<DateConverter>>> to be compliant to XML Schema date notation) no matter to which class the respective field belongs or to what XML dialect your class belongs.
    You can also restrict this to a given XML dialect such that the default converter is still used for all other dialects.
    Or you declare that for a specific field of a specific class another converter should be used.
  
  * Inheritance
    
    All annotations of the super class (and its super class and so on) of a given class are taken into account
    
  * Type reduction
  
    When serializing an object of type A, but no mapping is registered for A but for B with A being a subtype of B, then
    A is serialized according to the mapping for B. Thus the type of the object is reduced to B when serializing it.
    
    Note: JSefa supports also polymorphism as an alternative to type reduction, but only for XML (see below).
    
  * Detection of cycles in the object graph during serialization
  
  * Validation
  
    Validation support ranges from simple "value is required" to user defined validators. 
    
  * Exchangeable low level serializer/deserializer
  
    E. g. the JSefa XML serializer/deserializer is based on a low level serializer/deserializer, which operates directly on elements, attributes and text content.
    JSefa provides an abstraction of the low level task of serialization/deserialization and thus allows for different implementations.
    The current default implementation is based on JSR 173 (Stax) for which in turn different implementations exist.
    
    Similar is true for CSV and FLR.

  * Support for direct usage of low level serializer/deserializer
  
    If you do not need high level serialization/deserialization and want to use the low level serializer/deserializer directly, you are free to use an implementation of <<<LowLevelIOFactory>>> directly (e. g. the <<<StaxBasedXmlLowLevelIOFactory>>>).

  * Access to low level serializer during high level serialization
  
    Each high level serializer gives you access to the underlying low level XML serializer. In the case of XML you can use the low level serializer to write an xml declaration, DTD declaration, start tags, attributes, text content and end tags.    
  
* XML

  * Namespaces
  
    JSefa allows for individual namespace prefix registration to be used on serialization. If no prefix is registered for a given URI, one is automatically created.
  
  * Explicit and implicit list of elements
  
  * Polymorphism
  
    If you have a class with a field of type A whereas A has relevant subclasses, then JSefa can handle this by adding a
    <<<xsi:type>>> attribute to the respective xml element to denote the actual type.
    For each involved class you can specify which type name should be used in such cases.
    
  * Compliant to XML Schema on names of standard simple types (xs:string etc.)
  
  * Automatic encoding detection on deserialization
  
    JSefa provides a <<<XmlReaderFactory>>> which creates a <<<Reader>>> for several alternative input sources (e. g. <<<InputStream>>>) with automatic encoding detection.
    The encoding detection takes into account the BOM (Byte Order Mark), the first 4 bytes of the input source and the <<<encoding>>> pseudo attribute of the xml declaration.
    
* CSV and FLR
  
  * Multi type serialization/deserialization
  
    JSefa allows for serializing objects of different types into the same stream and deserializing them back again.
    The different record types are denoted by a prefix which is the first field of each record (if multi type serialization/deserialization is chosen).
    
  * Field embedding
  
    For example you can serialize an object of class <<<Employee>>> with a field of type <<<Address>>>.
    For each <<<Employee>>> one CSV or FLR record is created (one line) with the <<<Address>>> fields embedded. This works recursively.
    
  * Sub records and sub record lists
  
    As an alternative to field embedding one can serialize/deserialize deep object hierarchies by defining sub records and sub record lists.
    This way the serialization of an <<<Employee>>> would result in a record for the <<<Employee>>> itself and another record (a sub record of the first) for the <<<Address>>>.
    This is achieved by prefixing the records.
    
    In contrast to field embedding this technique allows for serialization/deserialization of lists of objects.
    
  * Line filter
  
    A line filter allows for filtering out lines during deserialization. These lines can also be stored for later retrieval.
    The typical use case of a line filter is to filter out and retrieve headers and footers of CSV/FLR files.
    
  * Deserializer accepts records with more or less fields than declared
  
    Say your format (CSV or FLR) evolves and gets a new field at the end of the field list. Then an old implementation can still read the new format as well as the new implementation can read the old one.
  
  * Support for special record delimiters
  
    Some formats do not use a line break as a record delimiter but a special character instead. JSefa supports these formats.
